# Recalculating Voyager 2's Trajectory
Final Project for the fall 2017 "Modeling and Simulation of the Physicsal World" class at Olin College of Engineering. By Bogdan Vitoc and Daniel Connolly. See [presentation](#presentation) at the bottom for more details.

## Running

```
Install dependencies:
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Recompute planetary orbits:
$ python main.py regen_planets

Recompute voyager trajectory:
$ python main.py trajectory

Two rendering modes: 
$ python main.py update  # moves circles representing celestial bodies
$ python main.py trail   # creates circlse for each time step, leaving a trail
```
